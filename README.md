# tech-blog by Russell Morgan

## Description
Tis week created a tech blog application that allowed logged in users to post articles and blogs. Made a change to the single post to allow edit, delete and add comment. Was unable to get it to switch correctly. Ran into a problem with the user_id not being found for adding posts and comments. All-in-all a bad experience.

## Usage
To use locally visit github and clone the respository listed below.

## Errors
Beside the errors mentioned above, looks ok and works so-so. Don't expect a decent grade on this. Don't know why when clicking on a post from the home page it would spawn a new page.

Note: elected not to deploy to heroku because of the problems. I plan to finish this for my own satisfaction (not expecting to get it re-graded). I am getting behind and will need to work extra to get current. Looking forward to the React stuff.
